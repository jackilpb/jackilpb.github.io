									<h3>My name is Paul Breeding
										<br>
										Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
									<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My path to the computer science degree has been long but rewarding.  I have always wanted a computer science degree but decided to put it on hold and focus on my military career.  
										After I retired from the military, I took a position with a company and sank into a comfortable routine.  Completing my degree was always on my mind.  After a stressful day at 
										work, I decided it was time to sacrifice some free time to achieve on of my life-long goals.
										<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My journey through the computer science program exposed me to ideas and concepts I had not experienced before.  One of those concepts was using Agile software development to 
										organize software development within a team environment.  I took on the roles of Scrum Master and Project Owner.  Utilizing these roles, I managed the project, implemented the 
										changes and communicated with the stakeholders.
										<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most enjoyable topics was data structures and algorithms.  I have always been fascinated by how and why things work.  In CS-260 we learned about one of the more 
										interesting uses for data structures and algorithms, fighting crime.  IBM predictive analytics teamed up with the Memphis police department and created Operation Blue Crush.  
										Using large datasets and predictive algorithms, they reduced violent crime.<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My journey through computer science was not one without bumps.  Coding has always been my weakest link.  Software engineering and databases were a huge challenge for me.  
										In CS-250, I was asked to modify a program.  With determination, I preserved and completed the assignment.  Overcoming my weakness in coding has been the most rewarding aspect of 
										the computer science degree.<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security was the most surprising aspect of my journey.  I didn’t realize I enjoyed it so much.  I used Linux and network security tools to penetrate networks and analyze their 
										weaknesses.  After taking IT-320, I decided this was the path I wanted to pursue.  I plan on getting my masters degree in cybersecurity.<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first artifact I chose will be used for the first two objectives, software design and engineering and algorithm and data structures.  It’s a slide show program from CS-250 and 
										showcases my ability to improve on existing code.  For design and engineering, I intend to increase the slides from 5 to 10.  I will change the theme of the slideshow from top 5 
										destinations to my 10 favorite moments of the IU women’s basketball.  I’ll also change the background of the slideshow to a more appropriate team themed background.  For algorithms 
										and data structures, I will create an algorithm that automates the slide show.  It will play the slide show, then require the user to press the reset button to view the slideshow 
										again.  I will also use an array structure for the images used in the slides.  The array will replace the numerous if and if else statements.<br>  
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second artifact is a RESTful API written in Python and will access a MongoDB database.  This artifact is from CS-340 Client/Server Development.  The restful API I created has 
										basic CRUD functions.  I will add functionality by adding two routes to the code.  The first route takes a stock ticker that the user inputs and returns the year to date, 
										quarterly and weekly performances.  The second route requires the user to input an industry.  It then prints a report of the top 5 stocks in that industry based on profit margin.
