								<p><b>Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?</b> <br>
									The first artifact is the slide show program originally used in CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle in September 2019.  
									The program was a manual slideshow featuring the top 5 destinations from a travel agency with a button to advance the slide show and a button to view the previous slide.  
									<br>
									<b>Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms 
										and data structure?  How was the artifact improved?</b>
									<br>
									I chose this artifact because it was a nice simple slideshow and I could greatly enhance its function while at the same time keeping the code from becoming overly complex.  
									Adding the automation to the slideshow showcased my skills in algorithms and data structures.  I added a reset button and added the logic for the automation in with the reset 
									button, pressing the reset button doesn’t just reset the slide show to the first slide, it also restarts the slide show automation.  The enhancements I made changed the slide show 
									from a static slide show that required input from the user to view the next slide to one that automatically goes through all 10 slides once the program is started.
									<br>
									<b>Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One?  Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? </b>
									<br>
									Yes, I added automation to the slide show.  Once you launch the program, the slides will advance through all ten slides and stop.  Each slide will be displayed for 5 seconds.  
									If you press the reset button, the slide show will start over.  I also changed the ten if and if else statements to a single array of images.  I did this to demonstrate the use 
									of an array data structure.  I do not have any updates to my outcome-coverage plans.
									<br>
									<b>Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?</b> 
									<br>
									I learned quite a bit while working through one of the challenges I faced.  The challenge was getting the slide show to work properly after pressing the reset button.  
									If the next or previous button were pressed, the slide show wouldn’t continue through the entire slide show after the reset button was pressed.  For instance, if I pressed 
									the previous button several times then pressed the reset button, the slide show would only advance through the slide show the number of times I pressed the button.  The problem 
									was pressing either button changed the cardIndex number.  I realized I could fix this problem by resetting the cardIndex to 0 when the reset button was pressed.
