								<p><b>Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?</b> 
									<br>
									This artifact is a RESTful API written in Python originally used in CS-340 
									Client/Server Development in June 2020.  The program provided basic CRUD 
									(Create Read Update and Delete) functions to a MongoDB database.
									<br>
									<b>Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software
									 development? How was the artifact improved?</b>
									<br>
									I chose this artifact because it uses python and MongoDB instead of Java and SQL.  
									I wanted to use something that was a little different to showcase a range in ability.  
									This artifact is going to showcase my advanced querying skills and the ability to translate those querying skills into the python language.  
									I improved the artifact by adding to the basic CRUD capabilities and adding reports.  I added two routes to my code.  
									The first route takes a stock ticker that the user inputs and returns the year to date, quarterly and weekly performances.  
									The second route requires the user to input an industry.  It then prints a report of the top 5 stocks in that industry based on profit margin.
									<br>
									<b>Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One?  Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? </b>
									<br>
									Yes, I was able to add the advanced querying routes to the code and return the year to date, quarterly and weekly performances of a specific stock.  
									I was also able to choose an industry and return the top 5 stocks in that industry based on profit margin.  I do not have any updates planned.
									<br>
									<b>Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?</b> 
									<br>
									I learned quite a bit about python and MongoDB during this activity.  My only exposure to Mongo was during the CS-340 course.  It took a lot of research and 
									reading of the MongoDB reference manual to get the routes to work properly.  The biggest challenge was my experience.  MongoDB is a great alternative to 
									SQL and is easy to use.  Luckily, the reference material available is well written and easy to find.  Iâ€™m sure with more experience I would be able to write 
									these routes without relying on the reference material so much.
